// TO DO

// ANIMATIONS
// Death animation
// make crane more efficient

//BAY

//AGENT
//- work out BREATHLESS, DEATH states
//- still gets stuck in a SEARCH hit cube PUSH loop - investigate - timer not working // think this is done
//- keep rigid body constraints until PUSH is over - hmm have I done this..?Nope

//- change agent speed based on health
//- add cooperation and compete coefficients to state (like health)


// GANTRY
//- fix pick up cube - change move position to parent transform

// ADJUSTMENTS
// previously Changed the cube from mass 1, Drag 0.5, TO mass 1.5, Drag 1  - to make it harder for the agent
