// TO DO

// ANIMATIONS
// Death animation
// make crane more efficient

//BAY
//- make marker and ground flash on a goal
//- add marker

//AGENT
//- keep rigid body constraints until PUSH is over - hmm have I done this..?
//- first ‘wander’ head toward the centre of the nav mesh
//- change agent speed based on health
//- add cooperation and compete coefficients to state (like health)


// ADJUSTMENTS
// Changed the cube from mass 1, Drag 0.5, TO mass 1.5, Drag 1  - to make it harder for the agent
