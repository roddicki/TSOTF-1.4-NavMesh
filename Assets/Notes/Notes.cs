// TO DO

// ANIMATIONS
// Death animation
// make crane more efficient

//BAY
//- hilite bay area on flash / goal / fade edges

//BAY MARKER
//- correlate emmission material brightness with Agent health - dead agent = black marker

//AGENT
//- work out BREATHLESS, DEATH states
//- agents walking off the ground in the air
//- keep rigid body constraints until PUSH is over - hmm have I done this..?Nope
//- add ragdoll state to dead agents
//- spawn agents (link to bay and determine colour)


//- change agent speed based on health
//- add cooperation and compete coefficients to state (like health) .. 0.0 to 1.0 float


//GANTRY
//- fix pick up cube - change move position to parent transform

//ADJUSTMENTS
// previously Changed the cube from mass 1, Drag 0.5, TO mass 1.5, Drag 1  - to make it harder for the agent
