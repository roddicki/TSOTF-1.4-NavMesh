// TO DO

//BAY
//- hilite fade edges

//BAY MARKER
//- correlate emmission material brightness with Agent health - dead agent = black marker
//- design better marker

//AGENT
//- fix / new push animation
//- fix PantingInt 2, ProneInt 1 & PantingInt 2, ProneInt 0
//- keep rigid body constraints until PUSH is over - hmm have I done this..? good enough

// create 100% cooperative states

//- change agent speed based on health
//- add cooperation and compete coefficients to state (like health) .. 0.0 to 1.0 float

//ADJUSTMENTS
// previously Changed the cube from mass 1, Drag 0.5, TO mass 1.5, Drag 1  - to make it harder for the agent
