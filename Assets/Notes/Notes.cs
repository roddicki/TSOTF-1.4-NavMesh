// TO DO

// ANIMATIONS
// Death animation
// make crane more efficient

//BAY

//AGENT
//- still gets stuck in a SEARCH hit cube PUSH loop
//- slow down as apparoach bay so not to 'bang' other cubes
//- keep rigid body constraints until PUSH is over - hmm have I done this..?Nope
//- first ‘wander’ head toward the centre of the nav mesh
//- change agent speed based on health
//- add cooperation and compete coefficients to state (like health)
//


// ADJUSTMENTS
// previously Changed the cube from mass 1, Drag 0.5, TO mass 1.5, Drag 1  - to make it harder for the agent
